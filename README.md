# TrumpetfishColour
Code for visual modelling and image processing of trumpetfish models, as described in Matchette et al. 2025 Behav Ecol: https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/araf059  

To run the image processing pipeline, run the MATLAB script  
trumpetfish_image_processing.m

To generate anemonefish (used as a proxy for trumpetfish) cone sensitivity curves, run the R script  
anemonefish_cone_sensitivities.R  
This creates the file Anemonefish 400-700.csv, which is formatted for use in the ImageJ MICA Toolbox (Troscianko & Stevens 2015 Methods Ecol Evol)
